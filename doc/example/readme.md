# Docker-compose example

Edit the files (as you see fit) and run `docker-compose up` to start the example.
Note: notify need to run with ssl (if not hosted on localhost), so you might need to run it behind a reverse proxy (like nginx or traefik).

[example compose](docker-compose.yml)

also see [docs](../install/selfhosted.md) to see how to set the variables in [example env](prod.env).
